* auto fire / rapid fire that can be enabled/disabled
* once the auto fire is enabled, you have to press button 2, which will trigger auto fire on button 1. Button 1 can still be used for single shots, or you can keep it pressed to throw grenades
* most Amiga/C64 games do not use button 2. It is why button 2 enables auto fire on button 1
* LEDs indicating pressed direction, fire button, and state.
