* auto fire / rapid fire that can be enabled/disabled
* once auto fire is enabled you have to press button 2 and it will trigger auto fire on button 1. Button 1 can be still used for single shots, or you can keep it pressed to throw granades
* most of Amiga/C64 games do not use button 2, this is why it enabled auto fire on button 1
* LEDs indicating pressed direction or fire button
