**samiga** is an adapter connecting SEGA Gamepad to Amiga, C64, Atari, and similar systems. 
Here is the EasyEDA Project containing the latest version: https://oshwlab.com/mac.miklas/sega-pad-amiga-joystick-autofire

**samiga** has an autofire with the possibility to alter firing speed. It includes LEDs indicating direction, fire buttons, and the state of the autofire. It utilizes three switches that allow control of the autofire, LED light, and remap the jump from pad to a button.

The autofire differs from the one that can be found on regular joysticks. Usually, when an autofire is enabled, it will immediately start firing on button 1 or get activated once button 1 is pressed - this is not the case here. Once the autofire is enabled, you must press button 2 to trigger auto fire on button 1. Button 1 can still be used for single shots or kept pressed to throw grenades or load up energy for a powerful single shot.
