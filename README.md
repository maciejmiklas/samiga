samiga is an adapter for connecting SEGA Gamepad to Amiga and C64. Here is the EasyEDA Project containing the latest version: https://oshwlab.com/mac.miklas/sega-pad-amiga-joystick-autofire

samiga has the following futures:
* LEDs indicating direction, fire button, and state
* auto fire (rapid fire) that can be enabled/disabled
* usually, when an auto fire is enabled, it will immediately start firing on button 1, or it will get activated once button 1 is pressed - this is not the case here
* once the auto fire is enabled, you have to press button 2, which will trigger auto fire on button 1. Button 1 can still be used for single shots, or you can keep it pressed to throw grenades or load up energy for a powerful single shot
* most Amiga/C64 games do not use button 2. It is why button 2 triggers auto fire on button 1
