Adapter for connecting SEGA Gamepad to Amiga and C64
* Source: https://oshwlab.com/mac.miklas/sega-pad-amiga-joystick-autofire
* auto fire / rapid fire that can be enabled/disabled
* once auto fire is enabled you have to press button 2 and it will trigger auto fire on button 1. Button 1 can be still used for single shots, or you can keep it pressed to throw granades
* most of Amiga/C64 games do not use button 2, this is why it enables auto fire on button 1
* LEDs indicating pressed direction, fire button and state.
